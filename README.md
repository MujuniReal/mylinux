Hello, welcome to my repo 'mylinux'
This repo's main aim is to make old linux kernels compatible with this generation's compilers and assemblers. To help those learning about kernels and operating systems. That wish to compile/assemble old code.

The restructuring goes way back to the first version 0.01 and to the next versions that will catch my attention, so not all versions will be included here.
Any assembly code found on this repo is written following the AT&T syntax because it's the coolest syntax :).
Thank you Linus Torvalds
